                My Name is Philipp and I'm a science student at Philipps-University Marburg. To show off some of my programming skills, I made this webpage. Here you can catch a glimpse of what I am capable of as Python Delevoper. For creating this site 
                I chose Django as backend and Bootstrap as frontend frameworks. I even implemented a little tool for sudoku solving for you to play around with and to
                show off some self coded backend functionality. I hope you will enjoy it. In <a href="#aboutsite"><q>About this site</q></a>, I will go in to much more detail about the different frameworks 
                and the soduko solving algorithm i chose. Please feel free to check these out, too.

                            For creating a quick and responsive frontend, I chose Bootstrap as framework. Bootstrap follows the mobile first strategy in web development. It streamlines the process of making
                            a responsive and easy to use website for all devices. According to the fact that this site is for demonstration purposes only, Bootstrap allowed me to quickly generate this webiste from scratch.
                            Nevertheless, customization via CSS is possible, so I took some minor styling changes, too. If you want to know more about Bootstrap, just follow this <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">link to their website</a>.

                            Python in general is a very powerful programming language. Even though, Java is much more prominent for web delevopment, Python should not be considered to be less capable.
                            Django is a very well documented web framework entirely written in Python. It combines Pythons powerful backend capabilities with dynamic website features, while handling fast and secure
                            frontend to backend communication. This website was entirely build around Django. Its functionality goes far beyond what can be seen here. To demonstrate the usage of self written
                            Python code, I implemented a Sudoku Solver down below. All necessary HTML for the Sudoku Solver is dynamically written in Django-HTML. It can easily be transfered to any other Django
                            website out there. Just as this website itself, all necessary Django-Python-Code was written by me. This includes the code to show this page, the communication with the backend and 
                            the backend itself, including the sudoku solving algorithm. If you are curious about Django, check out the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">website</a> and its excellent documentation.

                            Now I will go into some details about the sudoku solving algorithm. It was entirely written in Python as object oriented and reusable code. To make it
                            usable by the Django backend, it just has to be imported as library. The core features of the solver are to provide
                            not just the solving algorithm itself, but also methods to format the given data in both directions, from frontend to backend and vice versa. This
                            part is crucial for the Django-HTML code to work properly. The goal was to achieve an intuitive and easy to use input form for the sudoku, where
                            the known numbers can easily be put in the right fields.<br>
                            As the given input data is transfered to the backend in 9 seperate blocks, the program needs
                            to rearange these blocks to yield a two dimensional Python list. This list is then passed to the algorithm itself, which tries all different numbers
                            possible, according to the sudoku rules. And then solves it in an recursive algorithm, trying to find all possible solutions
                            for the given sudoku. Regardless, if it is actually possible to solve it or not. Thus, I implemented a fail-save, which detects the number of empty
                            fields. As efficient sudokus, with only one possible solution, should have more then 17 numbers available at start, this approach seemed to be
                            reasonable. Please feel free to check out the source code on my github.

                I am Philipp M. MÃ¼ller and I started programming during my science studies for making my daily tasks more efficient and less time consuming.
                Soon I took a deep dive into Data Analysis with Python, where I learned to use libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib to automate my workflow. Wherever I could,
                I tried to implement as much of my coding skills into my work as possible. I even started to write useful programs for other students. Then, after being confident in my
                skills, I decided to work as a programing tutor to teach young people Python and to show them, what can be achieved with this versatile language.
                Over the past few years I dived into much more topics than just Data Analysis, such as Webdevelopment with Django, Artificial Intelligence and so on. To give a clue
                of what I am capable of, I created this Django Web Application for you to explore.

                Welcome to the Sudoku Solver. This program was written by me and can find
